# falling_sand_experiment
This experiment was created in 2 work days + an additional evening! It was made using Rust and the Bevy library.

For those who want to try it, you will need to be capable of compiling and running rust programs. If so, cloning this repo and doing a `cargo run` should do the trick. It may take a minute at first since Bevy is a chonker.
