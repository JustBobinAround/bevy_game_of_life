# Bevy Game of Life
This was forked from a cool project called [falling_sand_experiment](https://github.com/dfebs/falling_sand_experiment). The orginal intentions were to make some sort of logic gate simulator, however, after relizing there would be some complexity with over lapping wires, I decided to create conways game of life instead.

### Original Fork Notes:
This experiment was created in 2 work days + an additional evening! It was made using Rust and the Bevy library.

For those who want to try it, you will need to be capable of compiling and running rust programs. If so, cloning this repo and doing a `cargo run` should do the trick. It may take a minute at first since Bevy is a chonker.
